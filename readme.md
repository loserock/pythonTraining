# Python training
## Slides & source files

#### General infos
 - Slides were written in markdown (.md) files.
 - Most of code samples were made in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files. They are json formatted files, but even the GitHub can render these in pretty formatted version.

To build slides from markdown files, recommend to use [MARP](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/)!
